Access database files

You can use Access to manage all of your information in one file. Within an Access database file, you can use:

*    Tables to store your data.

*    Queries to find and retrieve just the data that you want.

*    Forms to view, add, and update data in tables.

*    Reports to analyze or print data in a specific layout.

Note:
* You cannot use a query to update or delete records in a web database or web app.
* Table Design view is not available for tables in web databases.
